## Lightweight big numbers library

This is the wheel-reinvention big integer library pursues a goal to
provide easy-to-understand interface that can give you an idea how it
might be implemented for dealing with the quite _Big Numbers_.

There is the fascinating [GMP library](https://gmplib.org/) for the same
purpose and you should use it everywhere you can as it has better
performance and well documented.

### Working with the library

### Supported compiler

The library actively uses C++11 standard. Compilers that supports features of C++11:

- GCC (version 4.9.0+)
- Clang (version 3.4+)
- MSVC++ (version 14.0+)

I would be pleased if someone tells me about other compilers.
